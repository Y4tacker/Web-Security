# Operating System(四) -- Threads

## Introduction

Resource of ownership is referred to as a process or task(进程或者任务) 
Dispatching is referred to as a thread or lightweight process(线程或轻量进程)

### Unit of Scheduling/Execution

Each thread has:

- An execution state (running, ready, etc.)
- Saved thread context when not running
- Has an execution stack
- Some per-thread static storage for local variables
- Access to the memory and resources of its process 

## Single-Thread

Single-threaded approach  refers to the traditional approach of a single thread of execution per process(单进程单线程), in which the concept of a thread is not recognized

- MS-DOS supports a single thread
- Some UNIX supports multiple user processes but only supports one thread per process

## Multithreading

Multithreading refers to the ability of an OS to support multiple threads of execution within a single process

## Benefits of Threads

- Takes less time to create a new thread than a process (创建快)
- Less time to terminate a thread than a process (结束快)
- Less time to switch between two threads within the same process (切换快)
- Since threads within the same process share memory and files, they can communicate with each other without invoking the kernel (通信快)

## Threads are Affected by Many Process Action

- Suspending a process involves suspending all threads of the process since all threads share the same address space
- Termination of a process, terminates all threads within the process
