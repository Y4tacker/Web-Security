# Operating System(四) -- Threads

## Introduction

- Resource of ownership is referred to as a process or task(进程或者任务) 
- Dispatching is referred to as a thread or lightweight process(线程或轻量进程)

### Unit of Scheduling/Execution

Each thread has:

- An execution state (running, ready, etc.)
- Saved thread context when not running
- Has an execution stack
- Some per-thread static storage for local variables
- Access to the memory and resources of its process 

## Single-Thread

Single-threaded approach  refers to the traditional approach of a single thread of execution per process(单进程单线程), in which the concept of a thread is not recognized

- MS-DOS supports a single thread
- Some UNIX supports multiple user processes but only supports one thread per process

## Multithreading

Multithreading refers to the ability of an OS to support multiple threads of execution within a single process

## Benefits of Threads

- Takes less time to create a new thread than a process (创建快)
- Less time to terminate a thread than a process (结束快)
- Less time to switch between two threads within the same process (切换快)
- Since threads within the same process share memory and files, they can communicate with each other without invoking the kernel (通信快)

## Threads are Affected by Many Process Action

- Suspending a process involves suspending all threads of the process since all threads share the same address space
- Termination of a process, terminates all threads within the process

## Thread States

Operations associated with a change in thread state

- Spawn(派生)
  - Spawn one with the creating of process
  - spawn another thread later when needed
- Block(阻塞)
- Unblock(解除阻塞)
- Finish
- Deallocate register context and stacks

## User-Level Threads (ULT，用户级线程)

- All thread management is done by the application
- The kernel is not aware of the existence of threads
- Multithread implemented by a threads library(线程库)
  - threads library一组供应用程序共享的应用级别的函数

### Advantages

- Less overhead of two mode switches(user mod and kernel mode) 
- Scheduling can be application specific
   （调度与应用程序相关，不同的应用程序可以采用不同的线程调度策略）
- ULTs can run on any operating system

### Disadvantages

- One thread is  blocked, all other threads of the process are blocked in fact
  - The process is block 
- A multithreaded application cannot take advantage of multiprocessing
  - As the unawareness of threads by the kernel

## Kernel-Level Threads(内核级线程)

- Kernel maintains context information for the process and the threads
- Scheduling is done on a thread basis(线程池)

### Over the disadvantages of KLT

- Overcomes the two principal drawbacks of the ULT
  - Multiple threads in one process can simultaneously run on multiple processors
  - One thread blocked cannot make the other threads within the same process blocked

### Disadvantages of KLT to ULT

The principal disadvantage is that transfer of control from one thread to another within the same process requires a mode switch(模式切换) to the kernel
